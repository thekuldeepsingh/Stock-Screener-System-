- **Comprehensive Scoring System**: Quantifies each stock's strength with numerical scores across four dimensions
- **Rating Classification**: Categorizes stocks into four clear rating groups:
  - 🔥 Strong Buy
  - ✅ Moderate Buy
  - ⏹️ Hold
  - ❌ Sell
- **Sector-Based Filtering**: Focus your analysis on specific market sectors
- **Detailed Explanations**: Understand exactly why each stock received its rating
- **Performance Visualization**: View price trends, moving averages, and score breakdown charts

## 📋 Project Overview

This Stock Screener System implements a professional-grade stock filtering tool using only Python concepts from Chapter 4 of [Practical Python for Effective Algorithmic Trading](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3S8FQ7C). 

The system evaluates stocks based on:

1. **Technical Analysis**
   - Price relationship to 50-day and 200-day moving averages
   - Golden Cross/Death Cross pattern detection

2. **Value Assessment**
   - P/E Ratio evaluation
   - Valuation categorization

3. **Financial Health**
   - Debt-to-Equity analysis
   - Balance sheet strength indication

4. **Income Potential**
   - Dividend yield assessment
   - Income generation capability

By combining these factors into a weighted scoring system, the screener provides actionable insights that would typically require multiple tools or platforms.

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Technical Components

- **Conditional Statements**: Uses if/elif/else constructs to evaluate multiple criteria
- **Nested Conditionals**: Implements complex decision trees for nuanced analysis
- **Loops**: Iterates through stock collections to process each security
- **Data Structures**: Organizes stock data in lists and dictionaries
- **Visual Formatting**: Implements color-coding and graphical elements for clarity

### Scoring System

The screener uses a point-based system to evaluate each stock:

| Factor | Criteria | Score |
|--------|----------|-------|
| **Technical** | Price > both MAs | +2 |
| | Price > 50-day MA only | +1 |
| | Price < both MAs | -2 |
| | Golden Cross present | +1 |
| **Value** | P/E < 15 | +2 |
| | P/E < 25 | +1 |
| | P/E > 40 | -1 |
| **Financial** | Debt/Equity < 0.3 | +2 |
| | Debt/Equity < 0.7 | +1 |
| | Debt/Equity > 1.5 | -2 |
| **Income** | Dividend > 4.0% | +2 |
| | Dividend > 2.0% | +1 |

The total score determines the final rating:
- **Strong Buy 🔥**: Score ≥ 5
- **Moderate Buy ✅**: Score ≥ 2
- **Hold ⏹️**: Score ≥ -1
- **Sell ❌**: Score < -1
